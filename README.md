# Artificial Intelligence for Fashion Recognition

## Description

This code demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize fashion items from images using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The code is written in Python using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework.

### Overview

The code performs the following steps:

1. Import TensorFlow and other necessary libraries.
2. Load the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of fashion items like clothes, shoes, and accessories.
3. Preprocess the dataset by scaling the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
4. Build a neural network model using the Sequential API provided by Keras, a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow.
5. Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
6. Train the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs.
7. Evaluate the trained model on the test data to measure its accuracy.
8. Make predictions on the test images using the trained model.
9. Visualize sample predictions and their corresponding confidence scores.

### Libraries Used

- TensorFlow: A powerful open-source machine learning framework.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.

### Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items, each belonging to one of 10 categories. The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

### Model Architecture

The neural network model used in this code consists of two fully connected (Dense) layers:

1. Flatten layer: This layer converts the 2D array of the input images into a 1D array.
2. Dense layer (hidden layer): This layer consists of 128 neurons with the ReLU activation function.
3. Dense layer (output layer): This layer consists of 10 neurons (one for each class) with the softmax activation function, which outputs a probability distribution over the 10 fashion categories.

### Results

After training the model, it achieves a certain accuracy on the test set. The code then visualizes some sample predictions along with their confidence scores to demonstrate the model's performance.
